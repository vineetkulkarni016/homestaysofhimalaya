## Development

Install dependencies and start the server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs from `index.js` on port `3000` by default and exposes API docs at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

### Requirements

This project requires **Node.js 18 or later** for native `fetch` support. For older Node versions, `node-fetch` is automatically loaded as a polyfill when `fetch` is unavailable.
